Road Cross Chicken
Cross the roads with varying spawning of cars utilizing power ups collected upon the way to jump over and shoot cars.
WASD to move, Space to jump (Once Unlocked) and LShift to shoot (Once Unlocked)
Dodge the cars and get to the end
Cars spawn in random intervals along streets, and using WASD you can move the chicken to dodge said cars. For cars to dodge, there are 3 different cars to add variety in challenge. Stage 2 introduces jumping, with taller cars that spawn in more frequently for you to get used to the jump mechanic. Then in stage 3 the shooting mechanic is introduced and the cars are even taller, to encourage you to shoot the cars. Every time you die it reloads the scene.
